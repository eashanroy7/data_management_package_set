## Competitor Analysis

In designing this custom data sanitization and minimization tool, several market-leading solutions were reviewed to assess the need for a tailored solution.

1. **Redgate SQL Clone**: Great for SQL Server environments with quick provisioning, but lacks cross-database support.
2. **Delphix**: A powerful, enterprise-level tool offering data virtualization and masking, but complex to set up and costly.
3. **Tonic.AI**: Specializes in data de-identification, highly customizable, but may not be cost-effective for small teams.

This custom tool aims to address these limitations by providing a flexible, open-source, multi-database solution tailored for efficient data sanitization and restoration in non-production environments.
